## How do I install these formulae?

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).

## Installation

First, make sure you have installed [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh) and
[`homebrew-cask`](http://caskroom.io/) if you haven't yet.

Then, run the following in your command-line:

    brew tap lyraphase/av-casks

## Usage

**Note**: For info run:

    brew info --cask <cask>

Once the tap is installed, you can install the Casks!

    brew install --cask <cask>

To uninstall run:

    brew uninstall --cask <cask>

Every little bit is appreciated! Thank you! üôè

## Migration

**TODO**:

- Migrate old Cask repos under this Tap:
  [ ] `trinitronx/homebrew-soundid-reference`
  [ ] `trinitronx/homebrew-bpm`

## Development

If you wish to contribute to this Cask, there is a helper `Makefile` with some
useful targets.

To checkout this repo and install in development mode:

    git clone https://github.com/LyraPhase/homebrew-av-casks.git
    cd homebrew-av-casks
    make install

This will install a symbolic link to this git repo under:

    $(brew --repo)/Library/Taps/LyraPhase/homebrew-av-casks

Then, you may edit and test the Homebrew Cask recipe from the cloned git repo
file location.

## Testing

To test:

    make test
